# Product Context

## NeoForge - Modern Web Application Platform

### Product Vision
NeoForge is designed to be a modern, efficient platform for building web applications that are both performant and maintainable. It aims to provide developers with a solid foundation that follows best practices while keeping the codebase clean and understandable.

### User Experience Goals
1. **Developers**
   - Quick setup and onboarding
   - Clear documentation and examples
   - Consistent patterns and practices
   - Reliable testing infrastructure
   - Efficient development workflow

2. **End Users**
   - Fast, responsive UI
   - Consistent design language
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Offline capabilities
   - Accessibility compliance

### Technical Philosophy
1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
   - Use vanilla JavaScript instead of TypeScript
   - Prefer browser-native features over large libraries
   - Keep dependencies minimal and well-vetted

2. **Performance First**
   - Optimize for initial load time
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Use efficient rendering patterns
   - Minimize bundle sizes

3. **Maintainability**
   - Consistent component patterns
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented code and APIs

### Current Challenges
1. **Testing Reliability**
   - Some components have flaky tests
   - Shadow DOM testing is inconsistent
   - Component registration issues in test environment
   - Test timeouts and race conditions

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Need for consistent patterns across components
   - Better isolation between components
   - Improved error handling and state management
   - More consistent event handling

### Success Metrics
1. **Development Efficiency**
   - Time to set up development environment
   - Time to implement new features
   - Test reliability and speed

2. **Code Quality**
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Number of linting errors
   - Bundle size and performance metrics
   - Accessibility compliance score

## Why This Project Exists
NeoForge exists to solve a common problem for bootstrapped founders: the need to launch technical products quickly without accumulating technical debt or incurring high infrastructure costs. Many founders struggle with:

1. Choosing the right tech stack that balances modern capabilities with cost-efficiency
2. Setting up a development environment that supports rapid iteration
3. Implementing best practices without slowing down development
4. Creating a system that can scale when needed but doesn't require expensive infrastructure initially

NeoForge addresses these challenges by providing a pre-configured, production-ready stack with clear development patterns and cost-optimized infrastructure choices.

## Core Problems Solved
- **Technical Decision Fatigue**: Eliminates the need to research and compare countless frameworks and tools
- **Development Environment Setup**: Provides a ready-to-use Docker-based development environment
- **Quality vs. Speed Tradeoff**: Incorporates best practices and testing without sacrificing development speed
- **Cost Management**: Optimizes for minimal infrastructure costs during the validation phase
- **Scaling Complexity**: Offers a clear path to scale when product-market fit is achieved

## How It Should Work
1. **Getting Started**:
   - Clone repository
   - Run `make setup` to initialize environment
   - Run `make dev` to start development servers

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Write code with hot-reload for instant feedback
   - Run tests to ensure functionality
   - Use provided component patterns for consistency

3. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Deploy to single DO droplet initially
   - Scale horizontally when needed

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Follow documented best practices
   - Leverage automated testing
   - Use monitoring and health checks

## Target Users
- **Bootstrapped Founders**: Technical or semi-technical entrepreneurs building MVPs
- **Solo Developers**: Individual developers creating products without a team
- **Small Startups**: Early-stage startups with limited resources
- **Side Project Creators**: Developers working on products in their spare time

## Success Metrics
- Time to first working endpoint: < 10 minutes
- Time to first deployment: < 1 hour
- Monthly infrastructure costs: < $15 during validation
- Lighthouse performance score: > 90
- Test coverage: > 80%
