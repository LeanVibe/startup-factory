# NeoForge Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
NeoForge exists to solve a common problem for bootstrapped founders: the need to launch technical products quickly without accumulating technical debt or incurring high infrastructure costs. Many founders struggle with:

1. Choosing the right tech stack that balances modern capabilities with cost-efficiency
2. Setting up a development environment that supports rapid iteration
3. Implementing best practices without slowing down development
4. Creating a system that can scale when needed but doesn't require expensive infrastructure initially

NeoForge addresses these challenges by providing a pre-configured, production-ready stack with clear development patterns and cost-optimized infrastructure choices.

## Core Problems Solved
- **Technical Decision Fatigue**: Eliminates the need to research and compare countless frameworks and tools
- **Development Environment Setup**: Provides a ready-to-use Docker-based development environment
- **Quality vs. Speed Tradeoff**: Incorporates best practices and testing without sacrificing development speed
- **Cost Management**: Optimizes for minimal infrastructure costs during the validation phase
- **Scaling Complexity**: Offers a clear path to scale when product-market fit is achieved

## User Experience Goals
- **Developer Experience**: Setup should take minutes, not hours or days
- **Code Readability**: Components and patterns should be intuitive and consistent
- **Debugging Efficiency**: Issues should be easy to identify and fix
- **Documentation Clarity**: Information should be comprehensive but accessible
- **Testing Confidence**: Test suite should provide confidence in code changes

## How It Should Work
1. **Getting Started**:
   - Clone repository
   - Run `make setup` to initialize environment
   - Run `make dev` to start development servers

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Write code with hot-reload for instant feedback
   - Run tests to ensure functionality
   - Use provided component patterns for consistency

3. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Deploy to single DO droplet initially
   - Scale horizontally when needed

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Follow documented best practices
   - Leverage automated testing
   - Use monitoring and health checks

## Target Users
- **Bootstrapped Founders**: Technical or semi-technical entrepreneurs building MVPs
- **Solo Developers**: Individual developers creating products without a team
- **Small Startups**: Early-stage startups with limited resources
- **Side Project Creators**: Developers working on products in their spare time

## Success Metrics
- Time to first working endpoint: < 10 minutes
- Time to first deployment: < 1 hour
- Monthly infrastructure costs: < $15 during validation
- Lighthouse performance score: > 90
- Test coverage: > 80%
