- Support efficient scaling when product-market fit is achieved

## Technical Requirements
- FastAPI backend with async support
- Lit 4.0 web components for the frontend
- Docker-based development environment
- Cost-optimized infrastructure with clear scaling paths
- Comprehensive testing support
- PWA capabilities for frontend

## Success Criteria
- Developer can set up the environment in minutes
- All tests pass with good coverage
- Frontend achieves high performance scores
- Backend supports async operations efficiently
- System can be deployed on minimal infrastructure
- Code follows established best practices
- Components use consistent patterns
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Current Focus
- Fix failing frontend tests one at a time
- Identify and preserve critical business logic
- Ensure components follow established patterns
- Complete PWA implementation
- Optimize bundle size and performance
