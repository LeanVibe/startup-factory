# Project Brief

## NeoForge - Modern Web Application Platform

### Project Goals
NeoForge is a modern web application platform designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable web applications. The platform consists of a frontend built with Lit web components and a backend built with FastAPI.

### Core Requirements
1. **Frontend**
   - Vanilla JavaScript (no TypeScript)
   - Lit web components for UI
   - Browser-native features
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. **Backend**
   - Async FastAPI endpoints
   - SQLModel for database interactions
   - Redis for caching
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Scalable architecture

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker-based deployment
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Cloudflare CDN integration
   - Monitoring and logging

### Current Sprint Focus
The current sprint is focused on improving the test coverage and reliability of the frontend components. Specifically:

1. Fix failing tests for web components
2. Implement a consistent approach to component testing
3. Ensure all tests run reliably in the CI environment
4. Document the testing approach for future reference

### Success Criteria
1. All frontend tests pass consistently
2. Test coverage meets or exceeds 80%
3. Tests run in under 2 minutes in the CI environment
4. Documentation is updated with the testing approach
