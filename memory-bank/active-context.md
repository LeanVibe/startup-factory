# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Addressing test execution hanging issues, particularly with badge.test.js
- Fixing failing frontend unit tests
- Investigating modal component test failures
- Resolving conditional rendering issues in components

## Recent Changes
- Updated badge component to handle both direct text content and slotted content for the title attribute
- Improved content detection in badge component's updated() lifecycle method
- Fixed atoms/input.test.js by adding .trim() to error message text content comparison
- Fixed input.test.js by updating test to handle conditional rendering of helper text
- Identified that helper text is not rendered when error is present in NeoInput component

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix test execution hanging issues, particularly with badge.test.js
2. Fix modal component "applies size classes correctly" test failure
3. Continue addressing remaining NeoInput test failures
4. Fix implementation issues in the NeoInput component (aria-required, reportValidity, etc.)
5. Review other components for similar whitespace and conditional rendering issues
6. Address test worker memory limitations

## Active Decisions
- Need to standardize component property naming conventions
- Tests should account for conditional rendering in components
- Consider adding whitespace trimming in components rather than tests
- Should establish consistent test setup patterns
- Consider adding timeout mechanisms for tests that might hang

## Current Challenges
- Test execution sometimes hangs, particularly with badge.test.js
- Modal component test failing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')"
- Test workers hitting memory limits
- Inconsistent property naming across components
- Multiple skipped test suites
- Tests expecting behavior that doesn't match component implementation

## Notes
- Badge component has been updated to handle both direct text content and slotted content
- Toast component tests now passing after fixing animation timing
- Input component atoms/input.test.js now passing after fixing whitespace issue
- Main input.test.js still has multiple failures beyond whitespace issues
- Helper text in NeoInput is not rendered when error is present (by design)
- NeoInput component missing implementation for reportValidity, aria-required, etc.

## Current Work Focus
- Investigating test execution hanging issues
- Fixing failing frontend tests, particularly focusing on the modal component
- Ensuring tests match component behavior or updating components to match expected behavior
- Addressing whitespace handling in component tests
- Fixing conditional rendering issues in components

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Component Patterns**:
   - Using Lit 4.0 web components for frontend
   - Following atomic design principles for component organization
   - Prioritizing browser-native features over framework features
   - Ensuring components are well-tested and documented

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Run tests with `npm run test:unit` for frontend components
   - Fix failures one at a time before moving to the next issue
   - Update tests to match component behavior when appropriate
   - Focus on event handling and component lifecycle tests
   - Consider adding timeout mechanisms for tests that might hang

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitoring bundle size during development
   - Implementing code splitting and dynamic imports
   - Ensuring PWA features work correctly
   - Testing performance on various devices and network conditions

4. **PWA Implementation**:
   - Adding service worker for offline support
   - Implementing web manifest
   - Setting up push notifications
   - Adding install prompts for better user experience

## Current Development Environment
- Using Docker for development
- Frontend with hot-reload for rapid feedback
- Backend with FastAPI for API development
- Local database for testing and development
