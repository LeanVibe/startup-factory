# NeoForge Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Fixing failing frontend tests, particularly focusing on the toast component
- Implementing proper event handling in web components
- Ensuring that component lifecycle and animations work correctly
- Addressing UI component issues one at a time

## Recent Changes
- Fixed an issue in the toast component's `close()` method
  - Added a `setTimeout` to properly handle animation before hiding the component
  - Added a `detail` object with the toast ID to the `neo-dismiss` event
  - Fixed the event dispatch sequence to ensure tests pass
- Previously identified issues with proper event handling in web components
- Worked through component tests to identify failing cases

## Next Steps
- Continue running frontend tests and fixing any remaining failures
- Focus on addressing one issue at a time to ensure stability
- Once tests are passing, review overall component patterns for consistency
- Complete PWA implementation based on the TODO list
- Work on optimizing bundle size and performance

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Component Patterns**:
   - Using Lit 4.0 web components for frontend
   - Following atomic design principles for component organization
   - Prioritizing browser-native features over framework features
   - Ensuring components are well-tested and documented

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Run tests with `npm run test:unit` for frontend components
   - Fix failures one at a time before moving to the next issue
   - Ensure test coverage is maintained for all new code
   - Focus on event handling and component lifecycle tests

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitoring bundle size during development
   - Implementing code splitting and dynamic imports
   - Ensuring PWA features work correctly
   - Testing performance on various devices and network conditions

4. **PWA Implementation**:
   - Adding service worker for offline support
   - Implementing web manifest
   - Setting up push notifications
   - Adding install prompts for better user experience

## Current Development Environment
- Using Docker for development
- Frontend with hot-reload for rapid feedback
- Backend with FastAPI for API development
- Local database for testing and development
