# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Fixing failing frontend unit tests
- Addressing component test failures related to whitespace handling
- Resolving conditional rendering issues in components
- Investigating test assertions that don't match component behavior

## Recent Changes
- Fixed atoms/input.test.js by adding .trim() to error message text content comparison
- Fixed input.test.js by updating test to handle conditional rendering of helper text
- Identified that helper text is not rendered when error is present in NeoInput component
- Discovered inconsistencies between test expectations and component implementation

## Next Steps
1. Continue addressing remaining NeoInput test failures
2. Fix implementation issues in the NeoInput component (aria-required, reportValidity, etc.)
3. Review other components for similar whitespace and conditional rendering issues
4. Address test worker memory limitations
5. Review and enable skipped test files

## Active Decisions
- Need to standardize component property naming conventions
- Tests should account for conditional rendering in components
- Consider adding whitespace trimming in components rather than tests
- Should establish consistent test setup patterns

## Current Challenges
- Test workers hitting memory limits
- Inconsistent property naming across components
- Multiple skipped test suites
- Tests expecting behavior that doesn't match component implementation

## Notes
- Toast component tests now passing after fixing animation timing
- Input component atoms/input.test.js now passing after fixing whitespace issue
- Main input.test.js still has multiple failures beyond whitespace issues
- Helper text in NeoInput is not rendered when error is present (by design)
- NeoInput component missing implementation for reportValidity, aria-required, etc.

## Current Work Focus
- Fixing failing frontend tests, particularly focusing on the input components
- Ensuring tests match component behavior or updating components to match expected behavior
- Addressing whitespace handling in component tests
- Fixing conditional rendering issues in components

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Component Patterns**:
   - Using Lit 4.0 web components for frontend
   - Following atomic design principles for component organization
   - Prioritizing browser-native features over framework features
   - Ensuring components are well-tested and documented

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Run tests with `npm run test:unit` for frontend components
   - Fix failures one at a time before moving to the next issue
   - Update tests to match component behavior when appropriate
   - Focus on event handling and component lifecycle tests

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitoring bundle size during development
   - Implementing code splitting and dynamic imports
   - Ensuring PWA features work correctly
   - Testing performance on various devices and network conditions

4. **PWA Implementation**:
   - Adding service worker for offline support
   - Implementing web manifest
   - Setting up push notifications
   - Adding install prompts for better user experience

## Current Development Environment
- Using Docker for development
- Frontend with hot-reload for rapid feedback
- Backend with FastAPI for API development
- Local database for testing and development
