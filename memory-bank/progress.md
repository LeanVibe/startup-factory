# NeoForge Project Progress

## What Works
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Docker development environment is operational
- **Backend API**: Core FastAPI routes are implemented and secured
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM is functioning
- **Frontend Foundation**: Lit web components architecture is in place
- **Component Library**: Multiple basic UI components are functioning:
  - Toast notification system (recently fixed)
  - Navigation components
  - Form elements

## Current Status
### Frontend
- **Test Suite Status**: Currently addressing failing tests in frontend components
  - Fixed `toast.js` component to properly handle animation and event dispatching
  - Added proper `detail` object to the `neo-dismiss` event
  - Toast test for dismiss event now passing
- **Component Implementation**: Most UI components are implemented but require testing
- **Page Routing**: Basic routing structure is in place

### Backend
- **API Endpoints**: Core endpoints are implemented
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system is working
- **Database Models**: Core models are defined and migrations are in place

### Infrastructure
- **Development Environment**: Docker setup is complete
- **CI/CD**: Initial pipeline configuration is present but needs refinement

## Known Issues
### Frontend Issues
1. **Test Failures**: Multiple frontend tests are failing:
   - `src/test/components/autoform.test.js`
   - `src/test/components/error-page.test.js`
   - `src/test/pages/dashboard-page.test.js`
   - `src/test/pages/login-page.test.js`
   - `src/test/pages/pricing-page.test.js`

2. **Syntax Errors**:
   - Syntax error in `src/components/theme-toggle.js` at line 2
   - Issues with `export` keyword in decorators

3. **Import Resolution Failures**:
   - Failed imports in multiple test files, such as:
     - `src/test/pages/404-page.test.js`
     - `src/test/pages/projects-page.test.js`

4. **Event Handling**: Components need consistent event dispatching patterns

### Backend Issues
1. **Session Management**: Session expiration issues detected in API client tests
2. **Performance Optimization**: API response times need improvement for data-heavy endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling required across API endpoints

## What's Left to Build
### Frontend Tasks
- Fix remaining test failures
- Implement responsive design improvements
- Complete PWA features (offline mode, notifications)
- Finalize theme system with dark/light mode

### Backend Tasks
- Implement remaining API endpoints for advanced features
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Set up automated data backups
- Implement rate limiting

### Infrastructure Tasks
- Finalize production deployment configuration
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement automated performance testing
- Configure CDN for static assets

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing frontend test failures one by one
2. Address syntax errors in theme-toggle.js
3. Implement consistent event handling pattern across web components
4. Update documentation with latest component patterns
5. Add comprehensive test coverage for fixed components
