- ⚠️ Decorator syntax issues in some test files

## Known Issues

1. Memory issues when running all tests together
2. Decorator syntax issues in some test files (e.g., autoform.test.js)
3. Lit running in dev mode during tests, causing warnings
4. PostgreSQL container collation issues preventing database creation
5. Database-dependent tests failing due to missing test_db

## Next Steps

### Frontend
1. Configure Lit to run in production mode during tests
2. Improve test helpers for browser API mocks
3. Document testing patterns and best practices
4. Create a comprehensive test coverage report

### Backend
1. Resolve PostgreSQL container collation issues
2. Create more tests that don't require database access
3. Implement better test isolation to reduce dependencies on shared fixtures
4. Follow FastAPI async patterns as specified in the backend rules
