# Progress

## What Works

- Backend API endpoints for user management
- Frontend authentication flow
- Dashboard page rendering
- Basic component testing infrastructure
- Component test helper utilities for shadow DOM testing
- Backend test factories for generating test data
- Backend test runner script with flexible options
- Comprehensive backend testing documentation

## What's Left to Build

- Optimize web component testing to resolve memory issues
- Complete the registration page tests
- Implement remaining frontend features
- Enhance error handling and validation
- Improve test coverage
- Resolve backend database testing issues

## Current Status

We've made significant progress on the testing infrastructure for both frontend web components and backend services. We've created:

1. A comprehensive web component testing guide
2. A component test helper library
3. An optimized test runner script for frontend tests
4. Updated test cases for the registration page
5. A flexible test runner script for backend tests
6. Factory classes for generating test data
7. Mock tests for backend components that don't require database access
8. Tests for all factory classes
9. A comprehensive README for backend testing

However, we're still facing memory issues when running the frontend tests and database connectivity issues when running backend tests. The frontend tests are encountering "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors, even with optimized settings. The backend tests requiring database access are failing due to PostgreSQL container configuration issues.

## Known Issues

1. **Memory Leaks in Tests**: The web component tests are consuming excessive memory, leading to crashes.
2. **Shadow DOM Testing Complexity**: Testing components with shadow DOM requires special handling.
3. **Component Lifecycle Management**: Ensuring components are properly initialized and cleaned up in tests.
4. **Event Propagation**: Events may not propagate as expected across shadow DOM boundaries.
5. **PostgreSQL Container Issues**: Collation settings preventing database creation.
6. **Database-Dependent Tests Failing**: Unable to create test_db database needed for most backend tests.

## Next Priorities

1. Resolve memory issues in web component tests
2. Complete the registration page implementation and tests
3. Implement remaining frontend features
4. Enhance error handling and validation
5. Improve test coverage
6. Fix PostgreSQL container configuration
7. Create more backend tests that don't require database access
