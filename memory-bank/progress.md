# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Frontend test suite is running with mixed results:
  - Several test files are passing successfully
  - Some test files are being skipped
  - A few tests are failing with specific issues
  - Memory issues in test workers need investigation
  - Test execution sometimes hangs, particularly with badge.test.js

## What Works
- Core Components:
  - Toast Component (17 tests passing)
  - FAQ Accordion (10 tests passing)
  - Testimonials (12 tests passing)
  - Theme Toggle (9 tests passing)
  - API Client (14 tests passing, with expected auth-related errors)
  - Atoms Input Component (8 tests passing after whitespace fix)

## What's Fixed
- Atoms Input Component:
  - Fixed whitespace issue in error message text comparison by adding .trim()
  - All 8 tests now passing in atoms/input.test.js
- Main Input Component:
  - Updated test to handle conditional rendering of helper text
  - Fixed "reflects property changes" test to account for helper text not showing when error is present
- Badge Component:
  - Updated to handle both direct text content and slotted content for the title attribute
  - Improved content detection in updated() lifecycle method

## Known Issues
- Main Input Component Tests:
  - Missing reportValidity implementation
  - Missing aria-required attribute
  - Password visibility toggle not implemented
  - Prefix/suffix slots not implemented
  - Form integration not working properly
  - Pattern validation not implemented
  - maxlength/minlength attributes not being set
- Badge Component Tests:
  - Default size property mismatch ('md' vs 'medium')
  - Test execution sometimes hangs
- Modal Component Tests:
  - "applies size classes correctly" test failing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')"
- API Client Tests:
  - Session expiration handling in tests needs review
  - Authentication token clearing test needs investigation
- Test Worker Memory:
  - Workers hitting memory limits during test execution
- Multiple Skipped Test Files:
  - autoform.test.js
  - form.test.js
  - dashboard-page.test.js
  - faq-page.test.js
  - error-page.test.js
  - login-page.test.js
  - docs-page.test.js
  - phone-input.test.js
  - home-page.test.js
  - tabs.test.js

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix test execution hanging issues, particularly with badge.test.js
2. Fix modal component "applies size classes correctly" test
3. Implement missing features in the main NeoInput component:
   - Add reportValidity method
   - Add aria-required attribute
   - Implement password visibility toggle
   - Add prefix/suffix slots
   - Fix form integration
   - Implement pattern validation
   - Add maxlength/minlength attributes
4. Investigate and resolve test worker memory issues
5. Review and enable skipped test files
6. Address API client authentication test failures
7. Document test setup requirements for new components

## Recent Achievements
- Fixed toast component dismiss test by properly handling animation timing
- Fixed atoms input component tests by addressing whitespace issues
- Updated main input component test to handle conditional rendering
- Improved badge component to handle both direct text content and slotted content
- Identified core issues in test setup and execution
- Successfully running multiple component test suites

## Blockers
- Test worker memory limitations
- Test execution hanging issues
- Inconsistent component property conventions (e.g., size values)
- Multiple skipped test suites need investigation
- Missing implementations in NeoInput component

## Notes
- Need to establish consistent naming conventions for component properties
- Consider implementing test setup documentation
- May need to optimize test execution to prevent memory issues
- Tests should be updated to match component behavior or components should be updated to match test expectations 
- Consider adding a timeout mechanism for tests that might hang
