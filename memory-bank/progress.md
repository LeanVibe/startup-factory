- Enhance error handling and validation
- Improve test coverage to meet 80% threshold
- Implement remaining database migrations
- Add performance optimizations

### Frontend

- Implement remaining frontend features
- Enhance error handling and validation
- Improve test coverage

## Current Status

### Backend Testing and Configuration
We've made significant progress on the backend testing infrastructure and configuration:

1. Fixed the `secret_key` configuration issue:
   - Identified that the `secret_key` field in the Settings class was defined without a default value, making it a required field
   - Added a default value for the `secret_key` field in the Settings class to ensure it works even when the environment variable is not set
   - Modified the model_validator to set a default secret_key value when in test mode
   - Successfully ran tests after fixing the configuration issue

2. Fixed database connectivity issues:
   - Created the missing `app` database that was required by the tests
   - Ran migrations to set up the database schema
   - Ensured the test database `test_db` was properly configured
   - Successfully ran tests that depend on database connectivity

3. Created a comprehensive test runner script (`backend/scripts/run_tests_fixed.sh`) with options for coverage reporting, verbosity control, test markers, maximum failure limit, Docker container rebuilding, and test database creation.

4. **Important: All backend tests must be run using the Docker testing setup to ensure consistent test environments.**
   - The Docker testing setup provides a consistent environment for all tests
   - It ensures that all dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis) are properly configured
   - It isolates the test environment from the local development environment
   - It automatically sets all required environment variables for tests

5. Improved test infrastructure:
   - Created a dedicated test environment initialization script (`backend/scripts/init_test_env.sh`)
   - Updated the Makefile with new commands for initializing the test environment and running different types of tests
   - Added automatic service detection and fallback mechanisms
   - Improved error handling and reporting in all testing scripts
   - Added proper timeout handling for service health checks

6. Verified admin API endpoints:
   - Confirmed that admin endpoints are properly registered in the API router
   - Created a dedicated test to verify the registration of admin endpoints
   - Identified and fixed issues with admin endpoint tests
   - Ensured that admin endpoints return appropriate status codes

7. Current test coverage is below the required 80% threshold:
   - Overall coverage is around 47%
   - Need to improve test coverage for admin endpoints, middleware, and core modules
   - Plan to add more tests for the remaining untested functionality

### Frontend Testing
We've made progress on the frontend testing infrastructure:

1. Created a comprehensive web component testing guide (`frontend/src/test/WEB_COMPONENT_TESTING.md`)
2. Developed a component test helper library (`frontend/src/test/helpers/component-test-helper.js`)
3. Updated the registration page test to use the new helper functions
4. Created a script to run tests with optimized memory settings (`frontend/run-tests.sh`)
5. Created a simplified version of the registration page test

## Known Issues

### Backend
- Test coverage is below the required 80% threshold
- Some tests are still failing due to missing fixtures or dependencies
- Documentation for API endpoints is incomplete

### Frontend
- Memory leaks in tests leading to excessive memory consumption
- Complexity in testing components with shadow DOM
- Challenges in component lifecycle management
- Event propagation across shadow DOM boundaries

## Next Priorities

### Backend
1. Increase test coverage to meet the 80% threshold
2. Create more tests for database operations and API endpoints
3. Implement better test isolation to reduce dependencies on shared fixtures
4. Follow FastAPI async patterns as specified in the backend rules
5. Run all tests with the improved Docker testing setup to ensure they pass

### Frontend
1. Resolve memory issues in web component tests
2. Complete the registration page implementation and tests
3. Implement remaining frontend features
4. Enhance error handling and validation
5. Improve test coverage
