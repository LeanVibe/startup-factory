- Implement remaining database migrations
- Add performance optimizations

### Frontend

- Implement remaining frontend features
- Enhance error handling and validation
- Improve test coverage

## Current Status

### Backend Testing
We've made significant progress on the backend testing infrastructure:

1. Created a comprehensive test runner script (`backend/scripts/run_tests.sh`) with options for coverage reporting, verbosity control, test markers, maximum failure limit, Docker container rebuilding, and test database creation.
2. Implemented a `UserFactory` in `backend/tests/factories.py` for generating test user objects.
3. Created mock tests for the metrics module to demonstrate testing without dependencies.
4. Resolved PostgreSQL collation issues by:
   - Creating a custom PostgreSQL Docker image with proper locale settings
   - Adding an initialization script to create the test database with correct collation
   - Updating docker-compose.dev.yml to use the custom PostgreSQL image
   - Creating a script to fix collation issues in existing installations
5. Added database-dependent tests:
   - Basic connectivity and collation tests
   - CRUD operations tests using factories
   - Model relationship tests
6. Created a dedicated script for running database tests (`backend/scripts/run_db_tests.sh`)

### Frontend Testing
We've made progress on the frontend testing infrastructure:

1. Created a comprehensive web component testing guide (`frontend/src/test/WEB_COMPONENT_TESTING.md`)
2. Developed a component test helper library (`frontend/src/test/helpers/component-test-helper.js`)
3. Updated the registration page test to use the new helper functions
4. Created a script to run tests with optimized memory settings (`frontend/run-tests.sh`)
5. Created a simplified version of the registration page test

## Known Issues

### Backend
- Test coverage is below the required 80% threshold
- Some tests are still failing due to missing fixtures or dependencies
- Documentation for API endpoints is incomplete

### Frontend
- Memory leaks in tests leading to excessive memory consumption
- Complexity in testing components with shadow DOM
- Challenges in component lifecycle management
- Event propagation across shadow DOM boundaries

## Next Priorities

### Backend
1. Increase test coverage to meet the 80% threshold
2. Create more tests for database operations and API endpoints
3. Implement better test isolation to reduce dependencies on shared fixtures
4. Follow FastAPI async patterns as specified in the backend rules

### Frontend
1. Resolve memory issues in web component tests
2. Complete the registration page implementation and tests
3. Implement remaining frontend features
4. Enhance error handling and validation
5. Improve test coverage
