## Development Workflow (SIMPLIFIED)

### For Founders (Primary Users)
```bash
python startup_factory.py                    # Interactive menu
python startup_factory.py --demo            # Show capabilities
python startup_factory.py --status          # System health
```

### For Developers (System Maintenance)
```bash
# Validate all components
python -m py_compile startup_factory.py
python -m py_compile tools/*.py

# Run system health check
python startup_factory.py --status

- **Cost Optimization**: Single provider, optimized prompts
- **Reliability**: Built-in fallbacks and retry logic

### AI Usage Patterns
```python
# NEW: Intelligent conversation-driven workflow
CONVERSATION_FLOW = {
    "founder_interview": "anthropic",     # 15-min business conversation
    "blueprint_generation": "anthropic", # Technical spec generation  
    "code_intelligence": "anthropic",    # Smart business logic creation
    "compliance_frameworks": "anthropic" # Industry-specific compliance
}
```
