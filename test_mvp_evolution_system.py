Test-Driven Development for MVP Evolution System

FIRST PRINCIPLES:
1. Product-market fit requires systematic MVP iteration based on real customer data
2. Founders need specific, actionable improvement recommendations, not generic advice
3. MVP evolution must align with business model and customer validation insights

TDD APPROACH:
1. Write failing tests for MVP evolution and improvement suggestion
2. Implement minimal MVP evolution system
3. Validate with realistic business scenarios

FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH: 
Static MVPs don't achieve product-market fit. Systematic iteration based on customer data does.
