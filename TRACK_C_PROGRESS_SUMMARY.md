- Multi-threshold alerting (warning at 80%, stop at 100%)
- Provider cost breakdown and analytics
- Historical spending tracking and reporting
```

### 3. Provider Health Monitoring
**File:** `tools/health_monitor.py`
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 60 seconds
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, success rate, cost efficiency tracking
- **Automatic Failover**: Intelligent provider selection based on health scores
- **Alert System**: Health degradation and recovery notifications

```python
# Key Features:
- Health status calculation (HEALTHY/WARNING/CRITICAL)
- Automatic provider scoring and selection
- Uptime percentage calculation
- Health alert callbacks for notifications
```

### 4. Enhanced Queue Processor Integration
**File:** `tools/queue_processor.py`
- **Real Provider Calls**: Replaced mock implementations with actual API calls
- **Budget Integration**: Budget checks before task execution
- **Health-aware Routing**: Use health monitor for optimal provider selection
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Real-time metrics including cost and performance data

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `tests/test_ai_coordination.py`
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
