Test-Driven Development for Customer Acquisition System

FIRST PRINCIPLES:
1. Founders need customers to validate their business (not just MVPs)
2. Customer acquisition complexity is a major barrier to founder success  
3. Industry-specific approaches are more effective than generic advice

TDD APPROACH:
1. Write failing test for customer discovery templates
2. Implement minimal customer acquisition system
3. Validate with realistic business scenarios

FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH: 
MVPs are worthless without customers. This system bridges the gap between "live MVP" and "first paying customer".
