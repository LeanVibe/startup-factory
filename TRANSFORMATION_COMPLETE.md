# 🚀 STARTUP FACTORY TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE

## The Vision Realized: From Complex Infrastructure to Founder-Focused Simplicity

**Mission**: Transform the startup factory from a "starter kit" to an "Autonomous Development System" that conducts AI-powered founder interviews and generates complete, deployed MVPs automatically.

**Promise**: "Talk to me for 15 minutes, get a live MVP in 25 minutes total."
