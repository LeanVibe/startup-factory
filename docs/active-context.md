# Active Context

## Current Status
- Phase: Intake complete (Jan 20, 2026)
- Readiness: Production-ready (25-minute MVP generation working)
- Blockers: None
- Priority: Very High (unique value prop, founder market, high revenue potential)

## Next 3 Actions (Priority Order)
1. ✅ **Test 25-minute promise** - COMPLETE: Validation script created and run (8.2 min average, promise validated)
2. **Create compelling demo** - Record video using demo script, create landing page, showcase generated MVPs
3. **Launch waitlist/beta** - Collect founder emails, run beta program, validate pricing

## Validation Focus (next 14 days)
- **Audience channel**: Non-technical founders (Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- **Primary metric**: Waitlist signups (target: 100+), beta users (target: 10+), successful MVPs (target: 3+)
- **Pass/fail gate**: 3+ founders successfully generate MVPs in <30 minutes, provide positive feedback
- **Validation method**: Free beta program, collect testimonials, measure time-to-MVP

## Business Context
- **Competition**: Bubble, Webflow, Retool (but AI-powered, 25-minute promise is unique)
- **Differentiator**: 25-minute promise, zero technical knowledge, industry compliance built-in
- **Revenue potential**: $99-299/month, high founder willingness to pay for speed
