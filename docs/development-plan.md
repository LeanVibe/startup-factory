## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Set up project structure
   - Create initial workflows
   - Begin cookiecutter template

2. **Key Decisions Needed**
   - Email service provider
   - File storage strategy
   - Monitoring tools
   - Database migration strategy

3. **Resource Needs**
   - Development environment
   - Test accounts
   - Domain for documentation
   - Cloud credits for testing

Remember:

1. Start with minimal viable features
2. Focus on developer experience
3. Maintain bootstrap-founder perspective
4. Document as we build
5. Test continuously
