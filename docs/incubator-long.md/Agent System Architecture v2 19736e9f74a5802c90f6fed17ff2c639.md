# Agent System Architecture v2

Below is a revised version of your document followed by a list of major changes along with the rationale (“ADS” style) for each improvement.

**Agent System Architecture & Workflows**

This document describes the overall architecture, workflows, and integration points of the Agent System. It outlines the components, their interactions, and the decision‐making framework to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**1. System Overview**

```
graph TD
    A[Web Interface] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Workflow Orchestrator]
    C --> D[Agent Network]
    D --> E[Shared Knowledge Base]
    E --> F[Vector Store]
    E --> G[Document Store]
    D --> H[Tool Repository]
    C --> I[State Manager]
```

*Summary:* The web interface funnels user requests through an API Gateway to a central Workflow Orchestrator, which then delegates tasks to a network of specialized agents. The shared knowledge base supports agents through vector and document stores, while the tool repository and state manager handle auxiliary functions.

**2. Agent Network Structure**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Strategic Agents"
        A[Vision Agent]
        B[Strategy Agent]
    end

    subgraph "Research Agents"
        C[Market Research Agent]
        D[Competitor Analysis Agent]
        E[User Research Agent]
    end

    subgraph "Technical Agents"
        F[Architecture Agent]
        G[MVP Designer Agent]
        H[Resource Planner Agent]
    end

    subgraph "Validation Agents"
        I[Problem Validator]
        J[Solution Validator]
        K[Market Validator]
    end

    A --> C
    A --> D
    B --> F
    B --> G
    C --> I
    D --> J
    E --> K
    F --> G
    G --> H
```

*Summary:* Agents are grouped by function—Strategic, Research, Technical, and Validation—to promote focused expertise. Inter-group interactions support a feedback loop from vision and strategy to execution and validation.

**3. Workflow States**

```
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ProblemDiscovery
    ProblemDiscovery --> ProblemValidation
    ProblemValidation --> MarketResearch
    MarketResearch --> SolutionDesign
    SolutionDesign --> MVPPlanning
    MVPPlanning --> Implementation
    Implementation --> Validation
    Validation --> [*]

    ProblemValidation --> ProblemDiscovery : Invalid Problem
    SolutionDesign --> MarketResearch : Market Misfit
    Validation --> SolutionDesign : Failed Validation
```

*Summary:* The workflow begins with discovering a problem and cycles through validation, research, design, planning, implementation, and final validation. Loops provide paths for re-assessment.

**4. Tool Integration Framework**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "External Tools"
        A[Market Analysis Tools]
        B[Data Processing Tools]
        C[Development Tools]
        D[Research Tools]
    end

    subgraph "Tool Manager"
        E[Tool Registry]
        F[Access Controller]
        G[Result Parser]
    end

    subgraph "Agent Interface"
        H[Tool Requester]
        I[Result Processor]
    end

    A & B & C & D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> I
    H --> F
```

*Summary:* External tools are registered in a central Tool Manager, which controls access and parses results. The Agent Interface then requests tools and processes their outputs, ensuring standardized integration.

**5. Memory and Knowledge Management**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Knowledge Base"
        A[Short-term Memory]
        B[Long-term Memory]
        C[Episodic Memory]
        D[Semantic Memory]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Systems"
        E[Vector Store]
        F[Document Store]
        G[Graph Database]
    end

    subgraph "Access Patterns"
        H[Direct Access]
        I[Similarity Search]
        J[Pattern Matching]
    end

    A & B & C & D --> E & F & G
    E & F & G --> H & I & J
```

*Summary:* The knowledge management system is divided into types of memory, supported by various storage systems. Multiple access methods (direct, similarity, and pattern matching) enable efficient retrieval.

**6. Agent Capabilities Matrix**

| **Agent Type** | **Primary Tools** | **Memory Access** | **External Integrations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vision Agent** | Market Analysis, Trend Detection | Long-term, Semantic | Industry Databases |
| **Strategy Agent** | Planning Tools, Risk Analysis | All Memory Types | Financial APIs |
| **Market Research** | Data Mining, Analytics | Semantic, Episodic | Market Data APIs |
| **Technical Agent** | Code Analysis, Architecture | Long-term, Semantic | Development Tools |
| **Validation Agent** | Testing Tools, Metrics | All Memory Types | Validation Frameworks |

*Summary:* This matrix clearly outlines the toolset, memory needs, and integration points for each agent type, ensuring clarity in role responsibilities.

**7. Communication Protocols**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Orchestrator
    participant Agent A
    participant Agent B
    participant Knowledge Base

    User->>Orchestrator: Submit Request
    Orchestrator->>Agent A: Assign Task
    Agent A->>Knowledge Base: Query Context
    Knowledge Base->>Agent A: Return Context
    Agent A->>Agent B: Request Collaboration
    Agent B->>Knowledge Base: Query Additional Info
    Knowledge Base->>Agent B: Return Info
    Agent B->>Agent A: Provide Input
    Agent A->>Orchestrator: Submit Result
    Orchestrator->>User: Return Response
```

*Summary:* The sequence diagram depicts a full round-trip from user request to final response, highlighting collaboration between agents and the role of the knowledge base.

**8. Decision Making Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Analysis] --> B{Confidence Check}
    B -->|High Confidence| C[Direct Action]
    B -->|Low Confidence| D[Collaborative Decision]
    D --> E[Multi-Agent Vote]
    E --> F[Consensus Building]
    F --> G{Final Decision}
    G -->|Approved| H[Execute Action]
    G -->|Rejected| I[Request Human Input]
```

*Summary:* This framework ensures that actions are taken only when confidence is high. Otherwise, collaboration, consensus, or human intervention is triggered.
