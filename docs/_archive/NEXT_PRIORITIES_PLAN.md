# Next Priorities Development Plan

**Created**: August 9, 2025  
**Status**: Post-Foundation Analysis - Critical Path Identified  
**Priority**: Foundation Hardening Before Feature Expansion

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Startup Factory has achieved a **solid 75% foundation** with excellent core component testing. However, **critical production systems are undertested**, creating significant regression risk. **Immediate focus must be on hardening the foundation** before building additional features.
