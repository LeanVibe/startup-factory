## üß† First Principles Validation

### **Fundamental Truth #1: Founders need customers to validate their business**
‚úÖ **SOLVED**: AI now extracts industry-specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FERPA) that directly impact customer trust and business viability.

### **Fundamental Truth #2: Time is the scarcest resource for founders** 
‚úÖ **SOLVED**: AI conversations reduce discovery time by asking the right questions upfront - no more generic back-and-forth.

### **Fundamental Truth #3: Technical complexity is a barrier to founder success**
‚úÖ **SOLVED**: Business intelligence happens automatically through natural conversation - founders don't need to understand technical frameworks.

```

### **Graceful Degradation**
```python
# Works with OR without API keys
if self.client:  # Real AI
    return await self._real_ai_conversation(context)
else:           # Intelligent fallbacks
    return await self._intelligent_fallback_conversation(context)
