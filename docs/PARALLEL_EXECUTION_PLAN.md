- Automatic testing and validation
- Daily integration between tracks
- Feature branch PRs for quality gates

### ðŸ‘¥ **Collective Code Ownership**
- Shared interfaces between Track A/B foundation
- Cross-track code reviews
- Shared documentation and standards
- Collaborative problem solving

### ðŸ“‹ **Clear Requirements**
- Detailed acceptance criteria for each task
- Executable specifications
- Regular customer feedback (human gates)
- Iterative refinement

### ðŸš€ **Small Releases**
- Feature-based commits
- Incremental functionality
- Early and frequent demos
- Fail fast, learn fast
