# Legacy Components and Artifacts

The following areas are retained for historical reference and should not guide current development. Prefer the core docs listed in `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`.

## Archived Docs (moved to docs/_archive/)
- AI_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md
- PHASE3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- ANALYTICS_TESTING_REPORT.md
- TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md
- NEXT_PRIORITIES_PLAN.md
- CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md
- docs/LAUNCH_PRIORITIES.md
- docs/PHASE_2_PLAN.md
- docs/NEXT_PHASE_OPPORTUNITIES.md
- tools/TESTING_SUMMARY.md
- tools/e2e_test_report.md

## Generated/Template Trees
- demo_generated_mvps/ — generated artifacts; consult per-project README
- worktrees/ — legacy multi-track development; treat as references only

## Superseded Concepts
- Multi-provider orchestration (OpenAI/Perplexity): replaced by single-provider Anthropic flow
- Complex orchestrator and template ecosystem: replaced by 6 core AI modules and conversation-driven generation

If you encounter conflicting guidance, defer to `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
