# Startup Factory Setup Guide - POST TRANSFORMATION

**Transform your business idea into a live MVP in 25 minutes through intelligent conversation.**

This setup guide reflects the **new simplified system** that replaced complex infrastructure with conversational AI.

---

## 🎯 The New Reality

**BEFORE:** Complex configuration with 95+ files, API key management, Docker setups  
**AFTER:** One command setup with automatic validation and guided configuration

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Prerequisites (Auto-Validated)
- Python 3.10+ (system will check automatically)
- Docker (system will validate and guide installation)
- That's it! No complex configurations required.

### One Command Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd startup-factory

# Run the system - it will guide you through everything
python startup_factory.py
```

The system will:
✅ Check all prerequisites automatically  
✅ Guide you through getting an Anthropic API key  
✅ Validate your setup  
✅ Launch the founder experience

---

## 🔑 API Key Setup (Guided Process)

### Only One API Key Needed
Unlike the old system that required 4+ API keys, you now only need:

**Anthropic API Key** (for Claude-3-Sonnet AI)
1. Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Set environment variable: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key`
4. Or the system will prompt you when you run it

### Automatic Validation
The system automatically:
- Checks if your API key is set
- Tests connectivity to Anthropic
- Provides helpful error messages and solutions
- Guides you to the correct setup if anything is missing

## 🔒 Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- **No data sent to third parties** except Anthropic for AI processing
- **Local generation**: All code created locally on your machine
- **API key security**: Never logged or stored permanently
- **Docker isolation**: Each MVP runs in isolated containers

### Best Practices
1. **Secure API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive data
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep system updated for security patches
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to generated admin dashboards
