# Transition FAQ: Main Agent Leadership

**Q: Why did the orchestrator change from Claude code to main agent?**
A: To improve autonomy, maintainability, and clarity in orchestration, the main agent now leads all coordination and escalation protocols.

**Q: What do I need to change in my workflow?**
A: Reference main agent as the orchestrator in all documentation, code comments, and escalation protocols. No changes to technical workflow are required.

**Q: Are human-in-the-loop gates still required?**

**Q: Who do I contact for issues with orchestration?**
A: Contact the main agent or the Tech Lead for any orchestration or escalation issues.

**Q: Is there any impact on existing projects?**
A: No disruption. All ongoing and future projects will use main agent leadership for orchestration.
