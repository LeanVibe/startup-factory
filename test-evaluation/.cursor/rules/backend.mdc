- Nomad for containers
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Cloudflare CDN (free tier)

# Testing
- Isolated test containers
- Factory Boy for test data
- Async test support
- Full coverage reporting

# Documentation
- Clear setup instructions
- Infrastructure diagrams
- API documentation
- Deployment guides

## Services
- API (FastAPI)
- Database (PostgreSQL 15)
- Redis (Caching)
- Tests (Isolated)

## Common Commands
```bash
make setup  # Initial setup
make dev    # Start development
make test   # Run tests

2. Focus on developer experience
3. Maintain bootstrap-founder perspective
4. Document as we build
5. Test continuously
